# Code Example for Matching Event Study

This repository contains a sample code for estimating an event study design on a sample of treated individuals who are matched to a control group. The matching is done on the propensity score and exact matching.

The code first simulates data and then estimates the event study on the simulated data.

The code relies on two stata tools:
- cellgraph 
- latexlog
